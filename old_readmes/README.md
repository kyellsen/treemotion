# TreeMotion

TreeMotion is a Python package for TreeMotion sensor data management. It utilizes SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Empirical Mode Decomposition for efficient data processing. The package offers various features such as drift compensation, plotting, tree comparisons, vibration parameter estimation, root plate inclination, and wind inclination curves. Please note that this is a beta version.

## Description

The TreeMotionSensor Data Processing Toolkit is a Python package designed to import, manage, and process data from TreeMotionSensors produced by IML Electronics. These sensors are specifically designed for analyzing the dynamic behavior of trees in response to wind conditions. The toolkit leverages popular packages like SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Empirical Mode Decomposition, while utilizing an SQLite database for data storage.

### Key Features

- **Data Import and Management**: The toolkit provides seamless functionality for importing and managing sensor data collected from TreeMotionSensors, ensuring efficient data handling and organization.
- **Temperature Drift Compensation**: Robust tools are included in the package to compensate for temperature drift in raw sensor data, enabling accurate analysis and interpretation.
- **Plotting Capabilities**: Users can generate informative plots to visualize recorded data, gaining a comprehensive understanding of tree behavior in dynamic conditions.
- **Tree-to-Tree Comparisons**: The toolkit allows users to compare different trees based on their sensor data, enabling insightful analysis and identification of patterns or anomalies.
- **Vibration Parameter Analysis**: Various vibration parameters can be extracted from the sensor data, providing valuable insights into trees' response to wind-induced vibrations.
- **Root Plate Tilt Determination**: The toolkit includes functionalities to determine root plate tilt angles for trees in the wind, allowing for further investigations into their stability and structural characteristics.
- **Wind Tilt Curves**: Users can generate wind tilt curves, providing a graphical representation of a tree's behavior under varying wind conditions.

Please note that the TreeMotion package is currently in the beta stage, and ongoing development and improvements are expected. Users are encouraged to provide feedback, report any issues, and contribute to the project's development.
